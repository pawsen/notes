### Theoratical <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#theoratical}

The theoretical efficiency can be estimated using the [capstan equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstan_equation) (belt friction equation)

T_2 = T_1 exp<sup>&mu; &beta;</sup>

{{< figure src="/home/paw/tmp/notes/notes/capstan_equation.png" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 2: </span>Capstan equation for belt friction" >}}

Using this simple friction law leads us to conclude that the frictional forces for a rope depends only on three things:

-   the tension in the rope
-   the coefficient of friction
-   the total angle of contact

{{< figure src="/home/paw/tmp/notes/notes/capstan_measured_friction.png" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 3: </span>11.1mm Sterling HTP rope, 90 degree bend over 60mm polished Aluminium tube, 75kg test mass: raise, rest, then lower." >}}

-   Once the tension reaches 90kgf, the mass leaves the ground.
-   After a short time, hauling stops and the mass is left to rest with a holding tension around 80kgf.
-   This sequence is repeated two more times with small spikes up to 96kgf ‚Äì these show the slightly larger effort required to overcome static friction.
-   The tension required to maintain upward movement is about 92kgf.
-   After a rest, the system is set to lower and the mass is lowered to the ground in one sequence with a lowering tension of about 53kgf.
-   The angle(Œ≤) through which contact occurs is 90 degrees, or œÄ/2 radians

The friction is calculated as

\\(\mu = \frac{\ln \frac{T\_{raise}}{T\_{lower}} }{2 \beta}\\)

\\(\mu = \frac{\ln \frac{92 kgf}{53 kgf} }{2 \frac{\pi}{2} } = 0.175\\)

| 4     | 8œÄ  rads = 4 round turns       | 81.31                                       | 1.23                                      |
| 5     | 10œÄ rads = 5 round turns       | 244.15                                      | 0.41                                      |
| 6     | 12œÄ rads = 6 round turns       | 733.15                                      | 0.14                                      |

We will get almost a 100-fold saving in effort when lowering if we take 4 round turns around an aluminium bar ‚Äì which is probably where the ‚Äú4-turn‚Äù rule-of-thumb for the tensionless hitch comes from

## Mechanical advantage <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#mechanical-advantage}

Notes from <https://www.ropelab.com.au/pulley-system-analysis/>


### Z-rig / 3:1 {#z-rig-3-1}

The mechanical advantage for a 3:1(Z-rig)

{{< figure src="/home/paw/tmp/notes/notes/z-rig-forces.jpg" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 4: </span>3:1(or Z-rig) with forces in yellow" >}}

The force on the free end of the rope is `1`, after pulley P2 with efficiency `P2` the force is `1*P2=P2` and after pulley `P1` the force is `P1P2`. The force acting on the block is the sum of all forces, `1+P2+P1P2`.

The MA for a Z-rig in two different configurations

1.  P1 is a pulley `P1=90%`, P2 is a carabiner `P2=50%`
2.  P1 is a carabiner `P1=50%`, P2 is a pulley `P2=90%`

|    | 1 | P1  | P2  | P1P2 | MA   |
|----|---|-----|-----|------|------|
|    | x |     | x   | x    |      |
| 1. | 1 | 0.9 | 0.5 | 0.45 | 1.95 |
| 2. | 1 | 0.5 | 0.9 | 0.45 | 2.35 |

(**x** indicates the term is used for calculating MA)

Since `P1` only appears in higher order terms, the MA is higher when `P2` has the highest efficiency. A general rule of thumb seems to be

> the best pulley closest to hand


### Generalization {#generalization}

As a premise, the number of terms in the calculation of MA for any pulley system follows

> Each term, a product of combination of pulley efficiencies, appears at maximum once in a calculated MA (1). Further, each pulley‚Äôs efficiency may appear at maximum once in each term (2).

ie, number of terms are \\(2^N\\) where \\(N\\) is the number of pulleys

{{< figure src="/home/paw/tmp/notes/notes/4pulley_combinations.png" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 5: </span>Four order terms in any 4-pulley system. The terms to include in MA have to be determined based on the actual setup/free body diagram" >}}

The first row shows how the terms contribute to the MA, assuming all pulley efficiencies as 80%.
