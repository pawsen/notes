### Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace {#infinite-jest-by-david-foster-wallace}

-   Den er svær, men også genial. Det er et helt unikt sprog, og så taler den ind
    i nogle ting, som fylder alt i dag.
-   Den handler om et vhs-bånd med en film, der er så god, at man ikke kan stoppe
    med at se den, så man ender med at dø foran tv'et. Den handler om mange ting,
    men særligt om, hvad underholdning gør ved os. Det, synes jeg, er enormt
    interessant.

### The Player of Games by Ian M. Banks (recommend) {#the-player-of-games-by-ian-m-dot-banks--recommend}

The Culture - a humanoid/machine symbiotic society - has thrown up many great
Game Players. One of the best is Jernau Morat Gurgeh, Player of Games, master of
every board, computer and strategy. Bored with success, Gurgeh travels to the
Empire of Azad, cruel &amp; incredibly wealthy, to try their fabulous game, a game
so complex, so like life itself, that the winner becomes emperor. Mocked,
blackmailed, almost murdered, Gurgeh accepts the game and with it the challenge
of his life, and very possibly his death.

#### review (-10 star) {#review--10-star}

Loy Machedo’s Book Review – The Power of Now by Echkart Tolle.

Before I start thrashing the book, let me give you a few interesting facts.
• The book was published in the late 1990.
• Initially around 3000 copies were printed.
• Oprah Winfrey the great influencer recommended this book in her magazine (did she even understand the book?)
• After this debacle, the sales shot up to 3 Million Copies translated into 33 languages. (Its no surprise why every author wants Oprah to recommend their book).

So lets start my review. Yes folks, My gazillion dollar book review that may be only 300 people per day may read. The big emphasis is on the word ‘may’.

Overview:
The author tries to give an explanation into topics like:
Life in the Now.
Ego &amp; Non Ego Enlightenment
The Manifested &amp; Not Manifested
Transformation &amp; Just being.
(not exactly in that order but that a small nutshell)

So that’s about it.

Now starts my Book Review.

People like Deepak Chopra, Echkart Tolle, Joe Vitale should either be spanked
until their bottoms become permanently so sore, that they should never be able
to sit on their rear end or they should be hung upside down covered in a pile of
stinking poo until they promise never to waste peoples time with their ‘woo-woo’
nonsense.

All Echkart Tolle has tried to do is splatter some spiritual words, some hard to
define concepts, mixed it up with some logical confusion, lots of mumbo-jumbo,
defined and twisted words, peppered it with mysticism, cooked it up with some
crack pot experience, sliced it with some anecdotes and repeated the same
concept is so many different ways – you will assume you are enlightened in the
end, simply because your brains are either fried or numb with nonsense.

I mean in a world filled with people who are illogical and confused about the
god myth, to the different kinds of gods and different versions of gods, you
bring some cocaine induced neutral sounding deep nonsense and the next thing you
know – everyone is holding hands, closing their eyes and feeling the warmth of
the spirit flow through them – which is nothing but BS!!!

I hated the book right from the time I read the first few lines. If you thought
Wayne Dyer was nuts and Deepak Chopra was off his Cuckoo, then Echkart is on
steroids of Self Delusion.

What a bloody waste of money, time and space these people are with their
nonsense. I think people should wake up, get real and stop following these
woo-woo teachers with their nonsensical philosophies.

Personally, he may appeal to a bunch of lost idiots on our planet (and I am sure
there are many of them), but I’m sorry, I am not part of that
mumbo-jumbo-om-chanting-peace-flowing-spiritual-seeking-delusional-club.

I am as real as they get.

Period.

Overall Rating
Minus 10 out of 10.

What a bloody waste of time!

And if anyone wants to purchase the books from me – PLEASE contact me ASAP!!!

#### The tower - Kelly Cordes {#the-tower-kelly-cordes}

Af Michale Hjort:
Jeg vil i høj grad anbefale Kelly Cordes bog, The Tower, der grundigt beskriver hele historien og giver den endegyldige tilbagevisning af Maestris påstående bestigning. En af mine bedste bjergbøger.
Her er et billede af et billede, som jeg tog på Restaurant Patagonicus i Chaltén af Maestri året inden den skæbnesvangre "bestigning" i 1959. Han står sammen med danskeren Andreas Madsen, der havde en estancia for foden af Cerro Fitzroy og den tyske fotograf og Madsens hjælper Ernest Standhardt. Manden til venstre er ukendt.


#### Everest {#everest}

To know more about Griffith Pugh, the scientist who helped make the successful summit of Everest possible, read "Everest, The First Summit," written by his daughter, Harriet Tuckey. Not only will you learn about the science involved in studying physiology and the use of oxygen, you will also learn a lot about the psychology and personality of the men who participated in the historic 1953 climb.

Another great resource is the book by Wade Davis, "Into the Silence,The Great War, Mallory and the Conquest of Everest."

The mistakes made because of unwillingness to accept new ideas and scientific resources resulted in many failed attempts and deaths in the early attempts to climb Everest. This book is a GREAT history book and psychological review of the men involved.

#### code review of DOOM &amp; W3D {#code-review-of-doom-and-w3d}

Fabien Sanglard har skrevet to ret fantastiske bøger, Game Engine og Black Book
om hhv. Wolfenstein 3D og DOOM. Jeg mener at han arbejder på en om Quake.

Han skiller både hardwaren fra tidspunktet og koden til DOOM fuldstændigt ad og
forklarer hvordan delene hænger sammen. Det er et ret imponerende stykke reverse
engineering.

Bogen om DOOM findes som PDF her, og kan bestilles på print:
