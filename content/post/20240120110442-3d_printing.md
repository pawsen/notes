## Increasing model strength {#increasing-model-strength}

The strength of a model is mostly defined by the number of perimeters (not infill). If you want to have a stronger print, increase the number of perimeters. That said, infill does help with compression resistance.

-   The two stiffest ones are cubic and gyroid, but cubic is stiffer and much faster! Printing the same size of infill takes 50% longer with gyroid
-   if you look for filament efficient option, go for adaptive cubic. It’s still quite strong, but very quick and efficient!

From [prusa documentation](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill-patterns_177130)

-   The Gyroid is our favorite and one of the best infills. It’s one of the few 3D structures that provide great support in every direction.

The first 3d-printed gun that got media attention was the [Liberator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_(gun)). With careful sprint settings it has a lifespan of  8–10 shots.

The history of 3d printed guns: [part 1](https://odysee.com/@THOR.THE.GOD:b/history-of-3d-printed-guns-%28re-upload%29:b), [part2](https://youtu.be/XAPM3sX5G_s?feature=shared) and a [list of 3D printed guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_3D_printed_weapons_and_parts).

A well know gun is the [FGC-9 Mk2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGC-9) (FGC: Fuck Gun Control). The creator JStark1809 died of heart related issues shortly after an arrest/search in Germany. He was 28, approx.

On one side measure the distances of the inner sides with a caliper, on the other side measure the distance between the outer sides. Try to measure the distances without the influence of the first few layers to avoid bias due to elephant foot.

You can use the calculator here to calculate the results: <https://yaqwsx.github.io/printer-calculator/#/shrinkage>

The calculator is intended for resin printers but shrinkage is still shrinkage and the "exposure bleeding" indicates overextrusion, even if negative values appear to mean overextrusion rather than underextrusion.


### TPU {#tpu}

Shore hardness test measures the hardness of elastic materials such as rubber, polymers and elastomers.
A higher Shore value indicates a harder material

-   Soft TPU (Shore 85A-88A): Extremely flexible and elastic. Can be stretched up to 700-1000% of its original length. Typically used for printing components that require high flexibility, such as phone cases and watchbands.
-   Medium TPU (Shore 90A): Possesses good flexibility and durability. Can be stretched approximately 500% of its original length. Used for drone components, orthotic inserts, sports equipment, etc. This is the most common type of TPU used in 3D printing.
-   Hard TPU (Shore 95A): Still flexible but more rigid. Maximum stretch of around 200-300% of original length. Suitable for applications that require a degree of flexibility as well as support, e.g. electronic enclosures, insoles, toys, handles, etc.

95A is the general, cheap TPU.
Keep the filament dry or heat it in the oven.

It might also me necessary to modify the Nextruder Idle Lever by printing a new [version](https://www.printables.com/model/596608-nextruder-modified-idler-lever).

> Loosen your idler as much as possible before you start loading the filament/printing. There is a high risk that the filament will tangle around the bondtech if there’s too much pressure on the string.
>
> You have to print very slowly, typical safe speed is 20mm/s. Generally, a maximum recommended speed for flexible filaments is 30-40mm/s, because you would risk clogging the nozzle if you set the speed too high. In PrusaSlicer we recommend using the „Flexfill 98A or Filatech FilaFlex40“ profile. It has an optimal speed set through the maximum volumetric speed (It is set to 1.5mm3/s, that’s approximately 17mm/s when using 0.2mm layer).

Use retraction for very flexible filaments, to prevent pressure buildup in the extruder.

### input shaping {#input-shaping}

> In control theory, input shaping is an open-loop control technique for reducing vibrations in computer-controlled machines. The method works by creating a command signal that cancels its own vibration. That is, a vibration excited by previous parts of the command signal is cancelled by vibration excited by latter parts of the command. Input shaping is implemented by convolving a sequence of impulses, known as an input shaper, with any arbitrary command. The shaped command that results from the convolution is then used to drive the system. If the impulses in the shaper are chosen correctly, then the shaped command will excite less residual vibration than the unshaped command. The amplitudes and time locations of the impulses are obtained from the system's natural frequencies and damping ratios. Shaping can be made very robust to errors in the system parameters.

## FreeCad {#freecad}

Extrude pins to height of Pad - bottom wall thickness

-   Container made, ie rounded square, pad. Go to `Part Design` -&gt; `Apply a dress up feature` -&gt; set a thickness.
-   Create a sketch on the bottom inner surface of the container, import the geometry of the rounded corners, create circles at center points for the corners, close the sketch
-   Pad the circles, set a `formula length` of `Pad.Length - Thickness.Value`.


### Ensure tangency across mirror plane <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#ensure-tangency-across-mirror-plane}

A smooth transition with a mirrored sketch:

-   add a horizontal construction line
-   make the right-most point and horizontal line tangent

[mirror_tangency.png](/home/paw/tmp/notes/notes/mirror_tangency.png)


### Using profile templates <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#using-profile-templates}

-   open `sketcher` wb
-   create sketch/profile (it does not matter on which plane - the clones will be oriented by changing `Map Mode`) and rename it on the tree view.
-   right click on main tree and click `create group`. This creates a folder where profiles can be dragged into
-   open `Part Design` wb and create a body and sketch a `path` that the profile will be swept along.
-   using a `subshape binder` from the wb will not work. A `binder` cannot change the `Map Mode`.
-   Instead, open `Draft` wb, select the profile and click `Modification/Clone` and drag the cloned profile into the `Body` in the tree view.
-   Set the `Map Mode` as desired, probably using a vertex and a line with `Attachment Mode` set to `Normal to edge`.
-   Go back to `Part Design`, Select the cloned profile and click `Part Design/Create additive feature/additive pipe`. Either `Add Edge` and select all the edges the profile should be swept along, or use `Object` to select the `path` sketch.

### Shape binder VS SubShape binder {#shape-binder-vs-subshape-binder}

-   The `Shape binder` only allows referencing different geometries of a single object.
-   The `SubShape binder` allows referencing geometries across objects or files.

    It is useful to use a `subshape binder` to bind different sketches together, ex. with a `Additive Pipe`. `Additive Pipe` can only sweep along edges of a single `Object`. If the path is made up of multiple sketches, select them, create a `SubShape binder` and use the binder as path.


### Compound VS Fusion (union) <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#compound-vs-fusion--union}

### Make polar array/polar mirror of a shape {#make-polar-array-polar-mirror-of-a-shape}


#### Part WB {#part-wb}

-   go to `draft WB / modifications / Array tools / polar array`

This creates a multi body object, which is not allowed in Part Design WB.


#### Part Design WB {#part-design-wb}

-   Select the body, go to `Part Design / Create a clone`. Create as many clones as needed, f.x three, and rotate the new Bodies 120° each using the `Placement / angle` property. Use the three clones to create a new `body` using `Part Design / Boolean operation`.
    All clones references the same original (which is not part of the new `body`. Make changes to the original and all the clones will have the same changes.)


### Mirroring offset features {#mirroring-offset-features}


#### Part Design WB <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#part-design-wb}

If the orientation of the `datum plane` is not as desired, try to rotate it along some axis.

### Reorient sketch, PartDesign WB <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#reorient-sketch-partdesign-wb}

Duplicate a sketch, `Edit/duplicate selected object`, and deselect everything except the sketch.

Select the new copy, go to `Sketch/Reorient sketch`, click ok to `Sketch with a support face cannot be reoriented. Do you want to detach it from the support`, select the plane it should be oriented on and close the Sketch.
Select the `reference` in `Attachment mode` and click `Flip sides` if needed.

Now we can e.g. `loft` between two sketches and edit the sketches if needed.
