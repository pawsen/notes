## naming conventions {#naming-conventions}

`UPPER_CASE` are constant. And we prefer `snake_case` and not `camelCase`.

Then to know a bit more, I found <https://stackoverflow.com/a/12629901>, which says that

-   `_foo`: semi private. from M import \* does not import objects whose name starts with an underscore, unless specified in `__all__`
-   `__foo`: is name mangled to prevent conflicts. Ie. `__foo` is textually replaced with `_classname__foo`.
-   `__foo__`:  indicate special method

`foo_`: Used by convention to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords.
`_`: name for temporary variables.


## toolchain {#toolchain}

`pyenv`, `pyenv virtualenv`, `pipx`, `poetry`

Install `pipx` using latest/system python.

```text
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
pipx install poetry
```

Perhaps some use cases would be helpful:

-   you want to install youtube-dlc in order to download Youtube videos for offline playback: use `pipx install youtube-dlc`
-   you are writing a Python script that uses the `requests` library: use a virtual environment and `pip install requests` within that environment
-   you want the black autoformatter to be available all the time for all Python projects, including one-off scripts, etc.: use `pipx install black`

Quick summary: `pipx` is for commands, `pip` is for libraries, and you should avoid globally installing libraries, opting to use virtual environments instead.


### pyenv {#pyenv}

```sh
pyenv install --list
pyenv install 3.8.5
pyenv shell 3.8.5
pyenv version
 3.8.5 (set by PYENV_VERSION environment variable)
pyenv local 3.8.5 # creates .python-version file
 3.8.5 (set by ./.python-version)

pyenv versions
```

`pyenv-virtualenv` is a plugin to `pyenv` that manages virtual envs.
It is a bit superfluous when using `poetry`. The big benefit is that the environment can easily be reused on multiple projects, without coping the `pyproject.toml` around. Maybe most useful for small hobby projects without too many dependencies and strict version requirements.

Install and initialize in `.zshrc`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv
if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

```sh
pyenv shell 3.8.5
pyenv virtualenv venv385  # or
pyenv virtualenv venv385 3.8.5
pyenv activate venv385
pyenv deactivate
```

It seems that libraries installed in the `pyenv` are inherited by the virtual env at creation time.

Remove installed pythons and virtual envs

```text
rm -rf $(pyenv root)/versions/
```


### poetry (virtualenvs) {#poetry--virtualenvs}

Managed by `poetry`.

In existing project, generate `pyproject.toml` by running

```text
poetry init -n
poetry add <package>
poetry install
```

or

```text
poetry new .
poetry add <package>
```

When in folder with `pyproject.toml` file, the `poetry` command can activate the env.


#### run the script {#run-the-script}

```text
poetry run python my_script.py
poetry run pytest
```


#### new shell {#new-shell}

```text
poetry shell
```

`exit`


#### Activate environment {#activate-environment}

The env. can be manually activated by

```text
source {path_to_venv}/bin/activate
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
```

`deactivate`


#### example {#example}

```sh
echo '3.7.8' > .python-version
ls -l `which python`
 /home/paw/.zinit/plugins/pyenv/shims/python
poetry init -n
poetry shell
ls -l `which python`
 /home/paw/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/pytest-EkUMCDTk-py3.7/bin/python -> /home/paw/.zinit/plugins/pyenv/versions/3.7.8/bin/python3
exit
source `poetry env info --path`/bin/activate
 /home/paw/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/pytest2-dY-rToy_-py3.7/bin/python -> /home/paw/.zinit/plugins/pyenv/versions/3.7.8/bin/python3
```
