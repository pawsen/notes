[Kramses github](https://github.com/kramse/security-courses/blob/master/presentations/pentest/simulated-ddos-workshop/simulating-ddos-workshop-exercises.pdf) have a pdf with examples on how to use `nmap` and `hping3`.


## host/port scanning {#host-port-scanning}

```sh
nix shell nixpkgs#nmap

sudo nmap -p 22,53,80,443 -T4 "10.0.45.0/24"
```


## Generating packages {#generating-packages}

```sh
nix shell nixpkgs#hping
sudo hping3 -q -c 10000000 -i u60 -S -p 80 10.0.45.15
```


## Monitoring packets {#monitoring-packets}

The bandwith and packages can be monitored using `ifpps` and `bmon`.

```sh
nix shell nixpkgs#netsniff-ng nixpkgs#bmon nixpkgs#tcptrack

ifpps -d DEV
bmon -p DEV
```


### tcptrack <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#tcptrack}

A favorite. Tells how much bandwidth is being used and also what protocol (service/port) and destination the transmission is taking place to. Very helpful when you want to know exactly what is using up your bandwidth

### bmon <span class="tag"><span class="ATTACH">ATTACH</span></span> {#bmon}

Shows how many bytes/bits and packets are received and sent. Invoke in `ascii` output mode with `bmon -o ascii`.
