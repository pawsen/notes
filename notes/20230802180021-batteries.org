** Test if it is pure nickel

*** The salt water test - corrosion
Nickel does not corrode easily, unlike steel which loves to rust. Take a piece
of nickel strip and scratch it up aggressively with strong sandpaper or a metal
file. Then mix up a cup of salt water (the exact amount doesn’t really matter).
Drop your scratched nickel strips in the water and wait a few days. If you don’t
see any rust forming, you’ve got pure nickel! If you see brown or orange rust,
you’ve got nickel plated steel strips.

*** The sanding/grinding wheel test - sparks from grinding
I developed this test on accident while experimenting with the first test. I
used a Dremel sanding wheel to scuff up the surface of a pure nickel strip and a
nickel plated steel strip before doing the salt water test. The pure nickel
strip was fairly uneventful, but when I used a sanding or grinding wheel on the
nickel plated steel strip, I got brilliant sparks shooting from the strip as
soon as the wheel ate through the thin nickel layer and contacted the steel.
Makes sense - steel creates spark showers. Apparently though, nickel does not,
and that makes this another great test. It’s also superior to the salt water
test because you get the result instantly. But if you’re still in doubt, go
ahead and toss the piece in salt water after you’re done grinding on it, and
that will verify the results of the grinding wheel test.

* PowerWall
** Fuses

For powerwalls made of recycled cells of varying/unknown quality, fusing each cell is recommended. According to the following video it is not necessary to fuse both sides of the battery. One side is enough.

5 Amps is sufficient

Three types of cell fuse
- [[https://batteryhookup.com/products/nickel-fuse-2p-wide-continuous-roll-by-the-foot-18650-cell-level-fusing][Nickel fuse, continuous roll]]
- Fuse wire, like 30AWG tinned copper. [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZBOSQJ][30AWG on amazon]] and [[https://youtu.be/QWZKIr5BcU0][fuse wire test]]. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge#Tables_of_AWG_wire_sizes][fusing current is seen in this table]]
  Can be either spot welded or soldered between battery and bus bar. [[https://secondlifestorage.com/index.php?threads/experiment-soldering-18650-capacity-fade.8217/][Welding should not decrease battery performance]] if done properly
- Glass fuses. Some recommend these over fuse wire, as they don't heat/glow. I prefer the fuse wire for ease of installation and it's neater.
