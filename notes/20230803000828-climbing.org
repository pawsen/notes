** carabiner broke by cross-loading from Grigri
[[http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/13200305300/Fall-on-Rock-Inadequate-Protection-Inadequate-Clothing-and-Equipment-Weather][incident]] and [[http://www.rockclimbing.com/cgi-bin/forum/gforum.cgi?do=post_view_flat;post=168185;page=1;sb=post_latest_reply;so=ASC;mh=25;][discussion]]
lesson: use carabiner which prevents the grigri from rotating in the bin.
** Using ascenders as belay devise

* Tech tips
** anchors
[[https://www.climbing.com/skills/tech-tip-sport-streamlining-anchors/][Bowline with two loops]]
** Rappelling
1. Attach a short prussic cord to your leg loop with a locking carabiner.
2. Tie a French prussic knot around the rope where you normally hold your
   braking hand.
* gear
p-led is called quick-links, [[https://www.google.com/search?q=delta+link+climbing][here]] shown as triangular shape (delta link)

** breaking strength of climbing rope (approx 13kN)
[[https://youtu.be/ZWaDh6-roMI?feature=shared&t=303][This]] test shows that a dynamic climbing rope breaks around 12kN in a drop test and 13-14kN in a slow pull test. Ie. the rope breaks around the same, whether it's a drop- or slow pull test.
** force on gear/climber when falling on dynamic rope (less than 6kN)

| anchor | climber | belayer |
|--------+---------+---------|
|      4 |     2.5 |       1 |

But having a ground anchor increases the forces. See this [[https://www.hownot2.com/post/big-climbers#viewer-djhjt][chart]]
