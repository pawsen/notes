* Bafang middrives
** M series kits (M510/M560/M820)
M620 (Ultra) and other motors (model format "Mxx0") requires bafang proprietary frame mounts.
Model format "Mxx5" are designed for converting bikes to ebikes with a bottom bracket attachment. See https://bafang-e.com/en/products/motors/m-series/.

The M series is an "upgrade" of the BBS series, and has some improvements but also switches to the (currently) non-hackable CANBUS controls. There is also a modest change in the mounting.

The M-series conversion kits have seen a bit of thrashing going on. Originally Bafang announced the M625 as the replacement for the BBSHD and the M325 for the BBS02. These new models have since disappeared. They now have the M615 and the M315 models, which appear to be the old models (BBSHD, BBS02) with new nomenclature, and the CANBUS controller instead of the UART one IIRC. There is a new model that is starting to roll out, the M635 (1000W), which adds torque sensing to the system. (The M620 has torque sensing, which I have and do like a lot.) Unless you want torque sensing then the old models will be fine, and if you want to hack the controller they are the way forward.

If you are looking for power over budget then the 1000W Bafangs are hard to beat, and can be modded with even more powerful controllers ($$$$). If you want good power as well as less weight then the 750W BBS02 is a good choice. A comparable conversion kit (to the BBS02) is the 750W Tongsheng TSDZ2, and it adds torque sensing for a smoother experience (available with custom open source firmware). For general use either of the 750W motors will be fine - you will not generally be using all of the power anyway.

If you are into hill climbing then there is never too much power...

** BBS models (BBS02/BBS02B/BBSHD) / only bottom brackets
Get the BBSHD. You will never regret the extra power and torque. Also, its 'Heavy Duty' and not prone to burning out like the '02.
*** Bottom Brackets Standards and how it fits :ATTACH:

To see if the BB motor and the frame will need bottom bracket spacers(could be stacked M6 washers), measure the distance from the center of the BB and to the frame chain stay(the rod going backwards towards the rear axle).
The distance should be at least 7cm (2 2/3"). Move the ruler out to determine the needed spacing. See the picture below.

I recommend the 500c but if you canâ€™t get the 500c the DPC-14 is a good 2nd bet

The DPC 14 is also called 850c
