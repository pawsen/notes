** Bottom Brackets Standards and how it fits :ATTACH:

https://www.empoweredcycles.com/blogs/news/101474694-bottom-bracket-standards-and-bafang-mid-drive-motors

To see if the BB motor and the frame will need bottom bracket spacers(could be stacked M6 washers), measure the distance from the center of the BB and to the frame chain stay(the rod going backwards towards the rear axle).
The distance should be at least 7cm (2 2/3"). Move the ruler out to determine the needed spacing. See the picture below.

I recommend the 500c but if you canâ€™t get the 500c the DPC-14 is a good 2nd bet

The DPC 14 is also called 850c
