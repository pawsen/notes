[[https://github.com/kramse/security-courses/blob/master/presentations/pentest/simulated-ddos-workshop/simulating-ddos-workshop-exercises.pdf][Kramses github]] have a pdf with examples on how to use ~nmap~ and ~hping3~.

* host/port scanning

#+begin_src sh
nix shell nixpkgs#nmap

sudo nmap -p 22,53,80,443 -T4 "10.0.45.0/24"
#+end_src
* Generating packages

#+begin_src sh
nix shell nixpkgs#hping
sudo hping3 -q -c 10000000 -i u60 -S -p 80 10.0.45.15
#+end_src

* Monitoring packets

The bandwith and packages can be monitored using ~ifpps~ and ~bmon~.
#+begin_src sh
nix shell nixpkgs#netsniff-ng nixpkgs#bmon nixpkgs#tcptrack

ifpps -d DEV
bmon -p DEV
#+end_src

** tcptrack :ATTACH:

A favorite. Tells how much bandwidth is being used and also what protocol (service/port) and destination the transmission is taking place to. Very helpful when you want to know exactly what is using up your bandwidth

** bmon :ATTACH:

Shows how many bytes/bits and packets are received and sent. Invoke in ~ascii~ output mode with ~bmon -o ascii~.
